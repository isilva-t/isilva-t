# Hello, I'm Ivan Teixeira ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer studiyng with C/C++ at 42 Porto with a background in IT hardware/software maintenance.

## About me

I'm currently a student at 42 Porto, focusing on software development. Before joining 42, I worked as an IT technician specializing in hardware/software maintenance, which gave me a solid foundation in understanding computing systems and problem solving from the hardware level up.

I've been a Wi-Fi hobbyist for years, experimenting with wireless protocols and network setups in my free time before beginning my formal programming education. This hands-on experience with networking hardware sparked my interest in deeper technical learning.

When I'm not coding, I explore my interest in audio mixing and editing, which complements my technical background with creative problem-solving.
